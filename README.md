Kaggle competition - Show me the credit 

•	What is the question you hope to answer?
-	Since I’m using a kaggle competition data, the question for this project is a predefined: predict the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.  However, the competetion description does not explicity mention what qualifies as 'financial distress.' The data provided for the competetion has 12 columns, and they include  debt ratio, income, no of credit lines and no of times an individual was Number of times borrower has been 60-89 days past due but no worse in the last 2 years. 

•	What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
- Since this is a Kaggle competetion, the data is already provided. There is a total of four files provided by the competeteion: Test, training, data dictionary and a sample entry. 

•	What do you know about the data so far?
- Both the test and training data have 12 columns, the test has 101,503 rows whereas the training has 150,000 rows. The output has two columns, borrower id and probability of financial distress. 

•	Why did you choose this topic?
- I'm interested in learing about credit scores for low income borrowers - credit scoring is an interesting topic with some pitfalls. Specifically, it fails to distinguish between borrowers who have poor credit score due to poor spending habits and borrowers whose credit sccore got ruined by an unforseen circumstance. 
- Eventually, I'd like to work in a field that utilizes data science and finance, so this project is a good springboard.
